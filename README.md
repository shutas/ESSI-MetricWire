This is a script that automates the process of logging into a MetricWire Research account.
  
  
# Prerequisites
You need to make sure that you have all of the following for the code to run properly:

1. Mac  
Sorry to all of the Windows/Linux fans out there. The code won't run unless you have Safari;)

2. Selenium package for Python 2.7 or 3.4+  
If you have no clue what I'm talking about, you probably don't have it. It's easy though. Just run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -U selenium
```

If you have all this, you should be good to go!
   
   
# Troubleshooting
Don't worry. I got your back;) Here are some common problems you might run into...  

1. I don't have 'pip'!   
-> Easy fix. Just run the following command:
```
sudo easy_install pip
```

2. What version of Python am I using?  
-> This one's simple too. Check your python's version using:
```
python --version
```

3. What is 'Python'?  
-> Nope. I'm not answering this one. If you don't know what python is, you shouldn't be here. Go watch YouTube instead.
